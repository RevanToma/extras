An announcement will be made over the coming days\".Ronaldo turned 40 last week with his current contract due to end in June 2025. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star joined Al Nassr in January 2023 and has since scored 82 goals in 90 matches. In August, Ronaldo said he would stay with Al Nassr through the end of his professional career, which may be \"soon or in two or three years\".\"But it'll most likely happen with Al Nassr, in the team that makes me happy... and where I feel good.\"The Portuguese great appeared to trade an end-of-career payday for football obscurity when he moved to Riyadh's Al Nassr two years ago in a deal said to be worth $250 million.But his influence became clear when he was followed by a parade of ageing superstars to the big-spending Saudi Pro League.Saudi Arabia was then awarded the 2034 World Cup in December, the crowning glory for the oil-rich kingdom's strategy of revamping its image through sports, tourism and culture.When Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel in August, he gained one million subscribers in just 90 minutes and 20 million within 24 hours. He currently has 73.5 million.Although World Cup glory has probably eluded him, unlike his Argentine rival Lionel Messi, records still dangle in front of the five-time Ballon d'Or and Champions League winner.Despite his prodigious form as he closes in on 1,000 professional goals in official matches, Ronaldo is yet to win a Saudi or continental trophy with Al Nassr, with the Arab Club Champions Cup of 2023 his only triumph with the club.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-02-11 09:00:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://www.enca.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/afp/2025-02/doc-36XJ3LX-@photo0.jpg.webp?itok=-UbpvdUg","source_id":"enca","source_priority":303755,"source_name":"Enca","source_url":"https://www.enca.com/news","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/enca.png","language":"english","country":["south africa"],"category":["top"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"c043f7a74e1fb7b1e177eb76c67d9035","title":"Kitchen Tips- Quick And Easy 4 Hacks To Peel Garlic Cloves Quickly","link":"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/food/tips-tricks/kitchen-tips-quick-and-easy-4-hacks-to-peel-garlic-cloves-quickly-article-118139524","keywords":null,"creator":["Sakshi Arora"],"video_url":null,"description":"Well, who doesn’t like adding a hint of flavour to the savoury dishes?
