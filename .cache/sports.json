He's going to doha, and playing those games in between,\" Cone told media men Sunday night, referring to Brownlee, who delivered 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in the series-clinching win for Ginebra.\"That will keep him sharp but we have to make sure not to overuse him, so we're really planning for load management with Justin,\" added the 67-year-old Gilas and Ginebra coach.Similarly, the American coach said they intend to put Fil-Cypriot big man AJ Edu and eight-time PBA Most Valuable Player June Mar Fajardo under load management, too, knowing they have two tough FIBA games coming up.\"People may be wondering why they aren't at the floor all the time (once Gilas plays in Doha) but we plan to keep them fresh all the time going to New Zealand and Taiwan,\" he said.Still, Cone expects the 36-year-old Brownlee to play with all his heart for the national team, something he has done magnificently in the last two years he has donned the Philippine team jersey.\"He plays with his heart. It's a pride thing for him,\" shared Cone. \"In the PBA, he plays for his livelihood, and this is where he makes his livelihood in the PBA. He doesn't make near the money in the national team than he does in the PBASo you can be sure he's playing hard when he goes back against NorthPort.\"Meanwhile, Brownlee said he looks forward to reconnecting with his Gilas teammates this week.\"I'm really looking froward to the trip. We haven't seen each other for couple months, so we just keep building chemistry and keep getting better,\" said Brownlee, who has helped Gilas to a 4-0 record in the first two windows to secure a spot in the FIBA Asia Cup set this August in Saudi Arabia.The Doha friendly tournament will feature host nation Qatar, Egypt, Lebanon and the Philippines from February 14-16.After the brief Doha sojourn, the Philippine team returns to Manila, before moving over to Taiwan and shortly, thereafter, Auckland in New Zealand for the final window of the Qualifiers.Gilas faces Taiwan on February 20, followed by New Zealand on Feb. 23 in two away games.The Philippines eyes to close the final window with victories.Gilas showed no mercy against Taiwan, smashing the foreign squad, 106-53 during the February 2024 window at the Mall of Asia Arena.And just last November, Gilas pulled the rug from under New Zealand, 93-89, marking the first time the Philippines defeated the former Oceanian basketball powerhouse since 2016.Young big man Kai Sotto, who stepped up big in the November window, won't be available this month since undergoing a knee surgery after tearing his ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) last December in a Japan B.League game.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-02-10 23:53:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/02/10/536895.png","source_id":"manilatimes","source_priority":33634,"source_name":"The Manila Times","source_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/manilatimes.png","language":"english","country":["philippines"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"c99b6e9ec019e040f57f0fd5e7326d71","title":"AP Sports SummaryBrief at 6:52 p.m. EST","link":"https://www.beloitdailynews.com/sports/pro-sports/ap-sports-summarybrief-at-6-52-p-m-est/article_3cdfd8be-2b9e-5d59-880b-ad827c29959e.html","keywords":null,"creator":["AP"],"video_url":null,"description":"NFL offseason priorities include health and safety, kickoff evaluation and expanding replay assist","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-02-10 23:52:53","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":null,"source_id":"beloitdailynews","source_priority":117938,"source_name":"Beloit Daily News","source_url":"https://www.beloitdailynews.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/beloitdailynews.jpg","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"f34d2c8299d5a0d377e2f10b8d289d88","title":"AP Sports SummaryBrief at 6:52 p.m. EST","link":"https://www.bdtonline.com/sports/national_sports/ap-sports-summarybrief-at-6-52-p-m-est/article_3cecbba6-1db0-53d7-8009-f64d772c32da.html","keywords":null,"creator":["AP"],"video_url":null,"description":"NFL offseason priorities include health and safety, kickoff evaluation and expanding replay assist","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-02-10 23:52:53","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":null,"source_id":"bdtonline","source_priority":33446,"source_name":"Bluefield Daily Telegraph","source_url":"https://www.bdtonline.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/bdtonline.jpg","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true}]
